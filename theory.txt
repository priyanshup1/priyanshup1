Advantages of ArrayList?
ArrayList is variable length.
Add any type of data into ArrayList.
Traverse in both directions.
ArrayList allows multiple null values.
ArrayList allows to add duplicate elements.
When ArrayList exceeds its capacity, then its size increases by 50%.
Retrieval is faster in ArrayList

Disadvantages of ArrayList?
Never used Arraylist when you have to do lot of insertion and deletion as this will force arraylist to adjust the elements present in the list instead used linkedlist.
When you want to add elements in the last or first and the arraylist size is 0, in this case you can use linkedlist to add specifically on top and bottom of list.
You can't maintain uniqueness.
Arraylist dont work on primitive values.
